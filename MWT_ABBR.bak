; Comments may be added by preceding with a semicolon
; Two group headings must exist: [AMINO ACIDS] and [ABBREVIATIONS]
; Abbreviations may be added; simply type the abbreviation and molecular
;   formula under the appropriate column in either section
; Note:  Only the first letter of an abbreviation is allowed to be capitalized
;
; The abbreviations in the Amino Acid section are treated as extended level
;   abbreviations:  they are only recognized when extended abbreviations are on
