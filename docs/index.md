# __<span style="color:#D57500">Molecular Weight Calculator</span>__
Calculates the molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids.

### Description
This program can calculate the molecular weight and percent composition of chemical formulas and amino acids, providing a graphical user interface to edit the formulas and parsing options. It recognizes user-definable abbreviations, custom elemental isotopes, and can display up to 20 compounds simultaneously. It also includes a Mole/Mass Converter, Formula Finder, Capillary Flow Modeler, Amino Acid Notation Converter, Peptide Sequence Fragmentation Modeler, and built-in calculator.
