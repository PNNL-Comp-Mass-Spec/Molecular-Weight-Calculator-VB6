; Language customization file for the Molecular Weight Calculator program by Matthew Monroe
;  Contact at alchemistmatt@yahoo.com and http://come.to/alchemistmatt/ or http://www.alchemistmatt.com/
;
; When customizing the phrases in this file, the ampersand symbol (&) signifies a
;  keyboard shortcut.  For example, the default value for key 1000 is &File.  When
;  running the program, the F in File will be underlined and the user may press Alt-F
;  to access the File menu (in addition to clicking on the file menu)
; To improve usability of the program, please try to include the & symbol in menu items
;  and buttons.  Note, however, that if two controls on the same form have the same & 
;  shortcut, they will not respond to the alt key in the usual way.
;
; In this file, items surround by brackets [] are section headers -- the program ignores them
;  when parsing the file.  The key values (1000, 1010, 1020, etc.) should not be changed, with
;  the exception that new caution statements may be added at the end of the file.
; Lines beginning with a semicolon (;) are also ignored since they are treated as comments
;  However, you should not place a ; at the end of a line with an actual key and caption.
;
; Keys with multiple values separated by a vertical line (|) represent multiple items loaded
;  into a ComboBox control.  When translating to other languages, you must keep the same number
;  of items in the list, or program functionality will be lost.  For example, key 7070 contains
;  hours|minutes|seconds  Thus, hours, minutes, and seconds will be loaded into a control, from
;  which the user may select one of them.  In Spanish, you would use 7070=horas|segundos|minutos
;
; If you create a new .Ini file for a foreign language and would like it posted on my
;  web page, simply e-mail it to me.

; Instructions Label
9700=The typical use of the Formula Finder feature is for when the monoisotopic mass (weight) of a compound is known (typically determined by Mass Spectrometry) and potential matching compounds are to be searched for.
9701=For example, a mass of 16.0312984 Daltons is measured for a compound containing Carbon and Hydrogen, and the possible empirical formula is desired.  Performing the search, with a weight tolerance of 5000 ppm results in three compounds, H2N, CH4, and O.  Within 500 ppm only CH4 matches, which is the correct match.
9702=To correctly achieve use this feature, the program must be set to Isotopic Weight mode.  This can be done manually by choosing Edit Elements Table under the File menu, or the program can automatically switch to this mode for you.
9703=Would you like to:
9705=The typical use of the Fragmentation Modelling feature is for predicting the masses expected to be observed with a Mass Spectrometer when a peptide is ionized, enters the instrument, and fragments along the peptide backbone.
9706=The peptide typically fragments at each amide bond.  For example, the peptide Gly-Leu-Tyr will form the fragments Gly-Leu, Leu-Tyr, Gly, Leu, and Tyr.  Additionally, the cleavage of the amide bond can occur at differing locations, resulting in varying weights.

14050=When a list of ions is imported into the program, ions of similar mass may optionally be grouped together via a binning process to reduce the total number of data points.  Next, ions around the precursor ion may be removed.
14055=Then, the intensities are normalized to the given maximum intensity and ordered by decreasing intensity.  The top-most ions (number of ions to use) are divided into distinct mass regions and the ions in each region again normalized.
14060=The masses of the predicted ions for a given peptide sequence are easily computed.  However, intensity values must also be assigned to the masses.
14065=The B and Y ions are typically assigned the same intensity while the A ion is typically 5 times less intense.  Shoulder ions (masses ± 1 Da from the B and Y ions) can be added, in addition to including neutral losses (H2O and NH3).
